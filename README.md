Description
The Student Enrollment Form project is a simple and efficient web application designed to manage student records. It allows users to add, update, retrieve, and reset student data through an interactive and easy-to-use interface. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of maintaining student information, eliminating the need for manual or paper-based records.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend and leverages JsonPowerDB (JPDB) for the backend. JsonPowerDB serves as a lightweight yet powerful database solution, offering seamless integration and fast performance.

Update Records: Any incorrect or outdated information can be modified directly through the form.
Reset Form: The form can be cleared at any time, ready for new data to be entered.
This project emphasizes simplicity and functionality, offering a clean user experience while demonstrating the powerful capabilities of JsonPowerDB.
